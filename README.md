# PHP2550 Project3: Simulation study
## Transportability of Prediction Models
 This is a project assignment in the Practical Data Analysis PHP2550 course at Brown University
 
 In this project the goal is be to build a risk score model using data from the Framingham heart study data and estimating its performance of in a population underlying the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) survey data using a simulation study. 
## Background
Simulation studies mimics the real world and serve as an invaluable tool for understanding complex systems
in a controlled and virtual environment. 
## Data: 
This study used data from Framingham Heart Study to model predictive logistic models for
predicting the risk of cardiovascular heart disease in men and women in the Nhanes population in the US and transporting results from the Framingham study to a simulated Nhanes sample based on the available covariate information from Nhanes data.
## Methods
The ADEMP principles was employed to conduct the simulation study with rigor and transparency, and to transport the prediction score from the Framingham study to a sample target population obtained from the Nhanes study. Simulations were based on the covariate information of the Nhanes sample based on the known probability and the specified population quantities set as the number of simulations.
## Results
The Framingham Model achieved a weighted Brier Score and AUC of 0.193 and 0.72 respectively for the model predictions on men and 0.117 on the model for predicting cardiovascular risk in women and an AUC of 0.78.
